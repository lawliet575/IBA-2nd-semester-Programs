*make stack of all shapes and draw that in paint component
*add stack in  top mostlayer 
*when the user clicks on add layer the new layer gets add up the stack becomes empty and 
becomes a new stack now every shape goes in that new stack which is added again into the 
top most layer

this way layering is done

for(int i=0;i<allshapes.size();i++){
            allshapes.get(i).draw(g);
         }
we have to create a paint program with dragging and drawing shapes like rectangle,circle,rightangle triangle etc.
there will be a layers option that will allow shapes to get stored in those layers and if i remove the layer 
the shapes will get erased from the program
there would be 2 colours stroke colour and fill colour
there will also be undo and redo functionallity for each sleected layer
we will also have to do filing
